# Neural Style Transfer

> The Neural Style Transfer algorithm was due to Gatys et al. (2015). 

> Harish Narayanan and Github user "log0" also have highly readable write-ups this lab was inspired by. 

> The pre-trained network used in this implementation is a VGG network, which is due to Simonyan and Zisserman (2015). 

> Pre-trained weights were from the work of the MathConvNet team.

- Upload ***content image*** as original image, then ***style image*** as the style you wanna transfer to.
- 100-epoch training is enough for 400x400 image. 
- Examples of transferring:
